#Regression Methods Used:

## About Lasso Regression: 
***Lasso regression*** is a type of linear regression that uses contraction. 
Shrinkage shrinks the data value to a center point, such as the mean. 
The Lasso method promotes a simple and sparse model (that is, a model with few parameters).

## About Lasso Regression:
***Linear regression*** attempts to model the relationship between two variables by fitting  linear equations to the observed data.
the linear regression line has an equation of the form Y = a + bX. Where X is the explanatory variable and Y is the dependent variable.
